In this assignment, you will implement a simple HTTP client and server. The client will
be able to GET correctly from standard web servers, and browsers will be able to GET
correctly from your server. The test setup will be two VMs, one server and one client. Each
test will use your client or wget, and your server or thttpd. Your client doesn’t have to
support caching or recursively retrieving embedded objects. HTTP uses TCP – you can use
Beej’s client.c and server.c as a base. Your server must support concurrent connections: if
one client is downloading a 10MB object, another client that comes looking for a 10KB
object shouldn’t have to wait for the first to finish.
